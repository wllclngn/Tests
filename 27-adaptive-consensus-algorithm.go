// ADAPTIVE CONSENSUS ALGORITHM - Dynamic Blockchain Consensus
// Intelligent consensus that adapts to network conditions, threats, and energy constraints
// Solves the blockchain trilemma: security, scalability, decentralization
//
// PROBLEM STATEMENT:
// Current blockchain consensus algorithms have fundamental limitations:
// - Proof of Work: Secure but energy-wasteful, low throughput (~7 TPS Bitcoin)
// - Proof of Stake: Energy efficient but centralization risks, validator control
// - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Fast but limited to small, known validator sets
// - Delegated Proof of Stake: High throughput but sacrifices decentralization
// No single algorithm optimizes for all conditions (network latency, threat level, energy cost)
//
// OUR APPROACH:
// 1. ADAPTIVE STRATEGY SELECTION (from TimSort/Sudoku experience)
//    - Real-time network condition analysis (latency, partition risk, node count)
//    - Threat level assessment (attack detection, stake concentration)
//    - Energy cost optimization based on grid conditions and carbon footprint
//    - Dynamic consensus switching without hard forks
//
// 2. INTELLIGENT PATTERN DETECTION (from Dragonbox experience)
//    - Transaction pattern classification (high-value vs micro-transactions)
//    - Network topology learning for optimal validator selection
//    - Attack pattern recognition for proactive security measures
//
// 3. DEADLOCK-FREE COORDINATION (from DFS experience)
//    - Non-blocking consensus participation
//    - Graceful degradation during network partitions
//    - Zero-deadlock validator communication protocols
//
// CONSENSUS STRATEGIES:
// - Green Mode: Proof of Stake for normal conditions (energy efficient)
// - Secure Mode: Enhanced PoW for high-threat periods (maximum security)
// - Fast Mode: Practical BFT for known validator sets (high throughput)
// - Partition Mode: Gossip-based eventual consistency (network resilience)
// - Hybrid Mode: Combined approaches for optimal security-performance balance
//
// TARGET IMPACT:
// - Solve blockchain trilemma with adaptive optimization
// - Enable enterprise blockchain adoption with security guarantees
// - Reduce blockchain energy consumption by 80-90% in normal conditions
// - Maintain decentralization while achieving 100,000+ TPS when needed
// - Automatic threat response without human intervention
//
